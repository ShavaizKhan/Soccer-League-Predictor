# Soccer League Predictor

## Overview
This project is a football league match data analyzer that utilizes the Beautiful Soup and Pandas libraries to extract and organize football league match data and statistics. The aim of the project is to showcase adept skills in data extraction and organization, as well as predictive modeling using machine learning techniques.

## Features
- **Data Extraction**: Utilizes Beautiful Soup library to extract match data from various football league websites.
- **Data Organization**: Organizes the extracted data using Pandas library to facilitate analysis.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Trains a Random Forest classifier using the extracted key statistics from over 1000 historical soccer matches.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Achieves an impressive F1 score of 0.85 in predicting the outcomes of a set of designated fixtures using the trained classifier.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for the development of the project.
- **Beautiful Soup**: Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files.
- **Pandas**: Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Python library for machine learning including the Random Forest classifier implementation.
